    <p class="sub-text"> through glance back, i realize most of the time when going on the internet with chrome, it is
       for academic purposes. i reach more for my phone/social media for personal questions. perhaps this is the way
       the internet has evolved, to reach out to real communities to answer questions rather than a search engine
       or an ai answer. i really like that concept, and i hope the internet continues to evolve and create safe spaces for certain communities, whether it be identity based, hobbies based, etc. another observation, i tend to use the search engine in three consistent spots: the classroom, my living room/kitchen, and my bedroom. often times i am also listening to music with my headphones through spotify. regarding the contrast of life online and life irl, i feel like life online is a lot more curated. real life is raw and unpredictable, which you hardly find online these days. overall, i feel like i learned a little bit more about my internet habits that i didn't notice before.
