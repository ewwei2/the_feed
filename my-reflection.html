    <p class="sub-text">through glance back, i realize most of the time when going on the internet with chrome, it is
        for academic purposes. i reach more for my phone/social media for personal questions. perhaps this is the way
        the internet has evolved, to reach out to real communities to answer questions rather than a search engine
        or an ai answer. another observation, i tend to use the search engine in three consistent spots: the classroom, my living room/kitchen, and my bedroom. often times i am also listening to music with my headphones through spotify. overall, i feel like i learned a little bit more about my internet habits that i didn't notice before.</p>
